# Quantum Ecosystem

### Vision
A comprehensive web portal serving as the central platform for quantum application development, distribution, and consumption within the Quantum Ecosystem.

### Quantum Hub Frontend Core Purpose
Provide a visually intuitive and powerful web-based environment for quantum developers to build, test, publish, and monetize quantum applications, while offering consumers a marketplace for discovering and subscribing to quantum solutions, aligned with the established UI design.

### Key Capabilities (Reflecting UI)

*   **User Management:** Signup, Signin, API Key management (as designed in Dashboard).
*   **Learning Center:** Structured Documentation portal (as designed).
*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Project creation from templates or existing projects (as designed in Develop section).
    *   Embedded VSCode IDE for coding (as designed).
*   **Dashboard:**
    *   Overview stats (Total Apps, API Requests, Avg Qubits, Revenue).
    *   Management of `My Applications`, `My Published Circuits`, `API Keys`.
    *   Views for `Hardware Usage`, `Analytics`, `Settings` (designs need detailing/implementation).
    *   Recent job/result tracking.
*   **Registry & Marketplace:**
    *   Browse, search, view details for open-source circuits (Registry) and commercial APIs (Marketplace).
    *   Download circuits, subscribe to APIs.
*   **Publishing:**
    *   Guided multi-step workflows for publishing circuits to Registry.
    *   Guided multi-step workflows for turning published circuits into commercial APIs for the Marketplace.
    *   Unified "Publish Project" workflow allowing choice between Registry and Marketplace.
*   **Hardware Browser:** View details and status of available quantum hardware.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** (Backend Driven) Triggering and visualizing pipeline runs initiated from the Develop environment or publishing workflows.

### Workflow for Quantum App Developers (Aligned with UI)

1.  **Onboarding:** Sign up/Sign in, explore Documentation, generate API Keys via Dashboard.
2.  **Development:** Navigate to Develop section -> Create New Project (selecting type/template) or open Recent Project -> Use embedded IDE to write/edit circuits -> Trigger runs/simulations (via IDE buttons/integration).
3.  **Dashboard Monitoring:** Track recent results, application stats, API key usage, and (future) hardware usage/analytics.
4.  **Publishing (Registry):** From Dashboard -> My Published Circuits -> Publish New Circuit OR from Develop -> Publish Existing Project (Select Registry) -> Follow multi-step UI workflow (Info, Upload, Review, Publish).
5.  **Publishing (Marketplace):** From Dashboard -> My Published Circuits -> select circuit -> Publish as API OR from Develop -> Publish Existing Project (Select Marketplace) -> Follow multi-step UI workflow (Select Circuit/Info, API Details, Pricing/Publication Details, Review, Publish).
6.  **Management:** Update published circuits/APIs via Dashboard.

### Consumer Journey (Aligned with UI)

1.  **Discovery:** Browse Marketplace/Registry, search, filter, view details/documentation.
2.  **Acquisition:** Download circuits from Registry / Get Trial or Subscribe to APIs from Marketplace.
3.  **Usage:** Consume subscribed APIs using credentials obtained via Dashboard -> API Keys.

*(Technical Architecture, Integration, etc., remain largely the same as before, focusing on implementing the functionality behind these UI designs)*

## Quantum Ecosystem Components

### Quantum Hub
- **Backend**:
  - User management and authentication
  - Project management and development environment
  - Registry API for quantum app distribution
  - Hardware integration for quantum computer access
  - Marketplace for app monetization
- **Frontend**:
  - Developer portal with IDE integration
  - App discovery and subscription interface
  - Analytics dashboard for developers
  - Hardware selection and management

### Quantum Apps Registry
- Standard structure for quantum applications
- Version control and CI/CD integration
- Testing framework and quality standards

## User Personas

### Quantum App Developer
- Uses Quantum CLI SDK to develop, test, and publish quantum applications to Quantum Hub Registry or Marketplace
- Receives monetization through marketplace subscriptions

### Quantum Consumer
- Discovers applications via Hub Registry & Marketplace
- Downloads application artifacts from Registry for running it on their own infrastructure
- Subscribes in the marketplace to receive API access credentials
- Consumes quantum applications via REST APIs

### Quantum Hub Developer
- Maintains and extends Hub infrastructure
- Utilizes CLI SDK for internal development

### Quantum CLI SDK Developer
- Implements and maintains the CLI SDK commands
- Supports the quantum application development lifecycle
