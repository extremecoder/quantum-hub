## Overview

Quantum Hub is a comprehensive platform for quantum application development, deployment, and execution. It serves as a centralized marketplace and management system for quantum applications, allowing users to discover, run, and share quantum algorithms on various quantum hardware backends.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Application Marketplace**: Discover, share, and run quantum applications
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Connect to IBM Quantum, AWS Braket, Azure Quantum, and more
- **Circuit Design & Visualization**: Create and visualize quantum circuits
- **Job Execution & Monitoring**: Run quantum jobs and monitor execution status
- **Hardware Selection**: Choose from various quantum processors
- **Results Analysis**: Visualize and analyze quantum execution results

## Architecture

The Quantum Hub is built on a modern microservices architecture with a clear separation between UI and backend services. All components are containerized for deployment in Kubernetes.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js/React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend Services**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB for persistence
- **Caching**: Redis for caching and session management
- **Containerization**: Docker/Kubernetes
- **API Gateway**: FastAPI-based API gateway
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

### Component Details

1. **Frontend**: Provides the user interface for interacting with quantum applications, including the marketplace, circuit editor, and results visualization.

2. **API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, request routing, and cross-cutting concerns.

3. **Circuit Service**: Manages quantum circuit definitions, transformations, and conversions to provider-specific formats.

4. **Execution Service**: Handles the execution of quantum circuits on various backends, job scheduling, and result collection.

5. **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, authorization, and user preferences.

6. **Databases**:
   - MongoDB for persistent storage of user data, circuits, and execution results
   - Redis for caching and session management
