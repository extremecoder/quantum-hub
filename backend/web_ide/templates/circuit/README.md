# Quantum Circuit Project

This template provides a starting point for creating quantum circuits using Qiskit. 

## Contents

- `main.py`: A sample quantum circuit implementation that creates and measures a Bell state

## Getting Started

1. Open the `main.py` file to see the sample code
2. Run the code to see the results of the Bell state experiment
3. Modify the circuit or create new circuits based on your requirements

## Requirements

This template requires the following Python packages:
- qiskit
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization)

## Documentation

For more information on quantum circuits and Qiskit, see the following resources:
