### Quantum Hub Frontend

### Phase 1: Core Portal & Dashboard Foundation
*   ✅ Implement user authentication backend integration for Signup/Signin.
*   ✅ Build Dashboard `API Keys` management functionality (generate, revoke, copy) and usage display.
*   Implement Dashboard `My Published Circuits` view (fetch data, display table, implement View/Update placeholders).
*   Build Documentation portal structure and content loading.
*   Implement basic `Settings` page structure.
*   Connect Dashboard Overview stats widgets to backend data sources.
*   Build the basic structure for `Hardware Usage` and `Analytics` tabs (data display TBD).
*   Implement the landing page content (category links, featured apps - data driven).

### Phase 2: Development Environment & Basic Publishing
*   Integrate Monaco Editor and configure for quantum development.
*   Implement `Develop` page: "Create New Project" flow (backend interaction) & "Recent Projects" list.
*   Connect IDE "Run" button to backend simulation/job submission.
*   Build the multi-step "Publish Circuit" (Registry) UI *functionality* (form validation, file handling API calls, backend interaction).
*   Build the "Registry" browser page functionality (search/filter API calls, display results, download links).
*   Build the "Hardware" browser page functionality (fetch data from backend).

### Phase 3: Marketplace & Advanced Publishing
*   Build the multi-step "Publish API" (Marketplace) UI *functionality* (selecting circuits, form validation, pricing logic, backend interaction).
*   Build the unified "Publish Project" workflow functionality, routing to Registry or Marketplace flows based on user selection.
*   Build the "Marketplace" browser page functionality (search/filter API calls, display APIs, subscription/trial button logic).
*   Implement subscription management logic (connecting UI buttons to backend billing/entitlement APIs).
*   Implement "My Applications" tab in Dashboard (needs clearer definition - likely showing subscribed APIs or deployed projects).

### Phase 4: Analytics, Usage & Refinements
*   Implement data fetching and visualization for Dashboard `Analytics` tab.
*   Implement data fetching and visualization for Dashboard `Hardware Usage` tab.
*   Refine IDE integration (e.g., output panel updates, status indicators).
*   Implement remaining Dashboard actions (e.g., "Update" circuit, "Revoke" key).
*   Add user feedback mechanisms (ratings/reviews on Marketplace/Registry).
*   Implement notification system within the Hub.

### Phase 5: Testing, Documentation & Launch Prep
*   End-to-end testing of all user flows.
*   Write user guides for all major features (Documentation section).
*   Accessibility testing and improvements.
*   Performance optimization.
*   Prepare deployment scripts/processes.

*(Timelines removed as they are placeholders, adjust based on your team's velocity)*

This revised plan acknowledges the significant UI design work already done and focuses the tasks on bringing those designs to life with backend integration and building out the remaining sections. Let me know what you think!
